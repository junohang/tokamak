## токамак project configuration

токамак supports project configuration for each project. This helps to resolve
editor and project options. `tokamak.toml` file will be used by helper in the future.
It should resides in with same level of `Cargo.toml`.
By default Cargo project generated with tokamak will create it also.
Here is an example `tokamak.toml` file.

```
[helper]
path = ""                                  # Reserved for future helper path and configurations
[options]
save_buffers_before_run = true             # Saving buffers before every cargo command run
general_warnings = true                    # Show general warnings
[project]
auto_format_timing = 5                     # Run auto formatting for project for specified interval (seconds)
```

## Upgrading to 0.4.0

Racer support is removed because RLS is going to be the one that will replace Racer.
Linter package is removed you can disable it in versions after `0.4.0`. Instead of linter, `diagnostics`
will be used from `atom-ide-ui` package.
